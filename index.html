                Mixing Instructions
            </h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Take the juice from one bottle of Ol' Janx Spirit.</li>
                <li>Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V — Oh, that Santraginean seawater! Oh, those Santraginean fish!</li>
                <li>Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzene is lost).</li>
                <li>Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in memory of all those happy hikers who have died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia.</li>
                <li>Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the dark Qualactin Zones, subtle, sweet and mystic.</li>
                <li>Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart of the drink.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle Zamphuor.</li>
                <li>Add an olive.</li>
                <li>Drink... but... very carefully...</li>

                All of these ingredients have been recently rarefied due to the destruction of the boring planet Earth.

                This has been severely handicapped due to human weakness. Double the alcohol for the true recipe.
